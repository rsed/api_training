============
This repo contains the Lab Files for the RightScale API Training Course.

There are 5 labs in this course:-
RSED-L-API-001-GettingStarted-SessionCreation
RSED-L-API-002-BrowsingCloudsDeploymentsServers
RSED-L-API-003-3Tier-Arrays-Monitoring
RSED-L-API-004-ManagingUsers
RSED-L-API-005-APITools-RightAPIClient

The PDFs are in the directory 'Lab Instruction PDFs'

The first document 'RSED-L-API-001-GettingStarted-SessionCreation' explains how to spin up an 'API Sender' server in AWS.

This server does a 'git clone' of this repo so all the supporting files will be in place before starting the labs.
